Particulate matters are one of the most important issues on air quality, creating health problems and dangerously increasing mortality. Air quality monitoring systems currently operated by government agencies span a rather sparse network and try to capture the image for larger areas using predictive models that often fail to reflect local conditions or the temporal evolution of phenomena distant from the location of the stations. The need for a more informed society on the quality of its environment and the spread of the Internet of Things has led to the implementation of low-cost monitoring systems that can be easily applied to public buildings and the urban fabric and provide a reliable and true depiction of reality, with data open to all and accessible in real time. These systems provide the ability for participatory air quality monitoring, with some of these having already world-wide implementations, where anyone interested can build a monitoring device and offer his data to the community in an open framework. The open bet is the reliability and precision of the measurements provided by the low-cost PM2.5 and PM10 particle sensors, with a lot of projects examining this subject.

This Android application that I built for my diploma thesis uses a Bluetooth Low Energy interconnection to the sensor and provides the user with the display of the information he collects, as also from other openly-available data sources on the Internet. During this thesis, software and hardware were implemented for this purpose, while utilizing data from the PatrasAir and hackAIR platforms on air quality in cities in Greece.
